# Analysis of Traffic-Related Air Pollution in an Urban Area Using Advanced Statistical Methods

Abstract—This study is about traffic-related air pollution in a
major urban area of a developing nation, focusing on carbon
monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10)
pollutants. The air pollutant measurements were taken at 30
different sites during three periods of the day: early morning,
morning rush hour, and evening rush hour. Using statistical
methods including missing value imputation, hierarchical clustering,
principal component analysis (PCA), and mixed-effects
modeling, the relationship between environmental variables and
pollutant concentrations are analysed. The results of the LSD
test indicate that particulate matter levels (PM2.5 and PM10)
do not vary significantly across different times of day, suggesting
stable levels of particulate matter regardless of traffic conditions.
However, CO levels were significantly lower during the early
morning compared to rush hours, reflecting higher traffic-related
emissions during peak periods. Hierarchical clustering identified
five distinct clusters of variables, and PCA highlighted that traffic
related variables in Cluster 1 consistently showed significant
associations with higher concentrations of pollutants, especially
during rush hours. The mixed-effects model further revealed that
certain site characteristics, particularly traffic related variables
are associated with elevated pollutant levels. Wind related variables
were also found to be have a slight association with pollutant
levels.
