# Analysis of Traffic-Related Air Pollution in an Urban Area Using Advanced Statistical Methods

This study analyzes traffic-related air pollution in an urban area of a developing nation, focusing on carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), using statistical methods such as PCA, hierarchical clustering, and mixed-effects modeling. The findings highlight that while CO levels peak during rush hours due to traffic, particulate matter concentrations remain relatively stable throughout the day, suggesting that other non-traffic sources also contribute to air quality issues.
